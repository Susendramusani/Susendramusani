## Data Science Projects

- **Tic-Tac-Toe AI Tournament**
- To boost competitiveness, we created four distinct Tic-Tac-Toe agents that used Minimax, Alpha-Beta,Minimax, Expectimax, and Q-Learning algorithms.
- Algorithmic upgrades resulted in a 30% increase in victory rates over the baseline random agent.
- Conducted a tournament with over 100 matches, keeping track of performance metrics like win rates, drawrates, and agent efficiency.
- Optimized match experience with an average time of less than three minutes, increasing engagement.
- Created an interactive console interface for agent selection and match execution, which improved user experience and accessibility.



- **Image Generation Using Diffusion Probabilistic Models**
- This study focuses on image processing approaches and neural network models for item detection, including preprocessing, autoencoder-based feature extraction, and pre-trained CNNs.
- The InceptionV3 model extracts features, which are then used to calculate cosine similarity and find comparable images.
- The autoencoder develops a compact representation and captures crucial visual information despite significant loss.
- The InceptionV3 model excels at feature extraction and efficient transfer learning for image recognition.
- Future refinements could enhance these tactics for real-world applications.


- **Object Detec􀆟on of Sunglasses and Cap Using Faster R-CNN**
- The project aims to recognize sunglasses and caps using a fine-tuned Faster R-CNN model, a special dataset,and advanced data preprocessing methods.
- The impact of upgrading to ResNet-50 with an FPN backbone is examined, with a focus on increased feature extraction across several scales and higher performance in complicated scenes with occlusions and overlapping objects.
- Customizing the prediction head with FastRCNNPredictor greatly increased mean Average Precision (mAP) by allowing for greater class distinction and bounding box localiza􀆟on.
- The report compares pre- and post-training performance, analysing training loss, mAP, and the effectiveness of fine-tuning and hyperparameter tweaking.
- Ethical considerations are handled, ensuring that the dataset was anonymized, no personally identifying information was obtained, and that it is only used for educational and scientific purposes.
